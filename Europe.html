      <p>What was the cause of World War II? World War II began in Europe on September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. 
         Great Britain and France responded by declaring war on Germany on September 3.Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany in 1933 following a series of electoral victories by the Nazi Party. 
         He ruled absolutely until his death by suicide in April 1945.The German Wehrmacht occupied European territory: as far east as the town of Mozdok in the North Caucasus in the Soviet Union (1942â€“1943) as far north as the settlement of Barentsburg in Svalbard in the Kingdom of Norway. 
         as far south as the island of Gavdos in the Kingdom of Greece with the help of a tactic called blitzkrieg.</p>
